This information was communicated by the lawyer for the Maradona family yesterday to the news agency The Associated Press.

The auction of the trophy, which symbolizes one of the greatest achievements in the history of Argentine football, has generated significant interest in the market. However, the heirs of the immortal footballer argue that the object should remain in the hands of the Maradona family and not be auctioned to the highest bidder.

This announcement comes in a context where debates about the proper management of Maradona's legacy, who passed away in November 2020, still persist. The family seeks to protect the honor and memory of a figure that transcends the sports field and has become an icon of Argentine culture.

The lawsuit is expected to be filed in the coming days, which could open a legal dispute over the ownership of the trophy and its future. As the situation unfolds, both football fans and followers of Maradona's career will be attentive to developments and the possible resolution of this crucial matter for the history of the sport.","**May 15, 2024, Paris**

The heirs of the legendary Argentine footballer Diego Maradona will file a lawsuit to prevent the auction of the trophy from the 1986 World Cup that Argentina won.

The family's lawyer, Matias Morla, announced the heirs' intention to The Associated Press on Monday. The auction is scheduled for next month in Paris.

The trophy, which shows two human figures holding the world, was awarded to Maradona after Argentina's victory in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. It is said to be worth millions of dollars.

According to Morla, Maradona's heirs consider the trophy to be a ""cultural and sporting heritage"" that should remain in Argentina. They argue that the auction would devalue Maradona's legacy and deprive the country of one of its most treasured sporting symbols.

The lawsuit will be filed in a court in Paris, where the trophy is currently located. It is unclear when a ruling on the lawsuit will be made.","On May 15, 2024.

*March 6, 2024*

*Mexico City* – In the context of an electoral period marked by uncertainty, experts in economics and public finance have highlighted the importance of conducting a thorough analysis of the public budget, regardless of who emerges victorious in the elections. This challenge becomes crucial to ensure that resources are invested in concepts that truly benefit the national economy.

Analysts emphasize that it is essential to prioritize those projects and budget items that not only promote economic growth but also generate a positive return in terms of social development and citizen well-being. Attention is focused on the need to implement measures that optimize the use of these resources, seeking to maximize their impact.

Furthermore, specialists recommend considering a tax reform that fosters the generation of additional revenue without burdening taxpayers or discouraging investment. This approach would improve revenue efficiency and ensure that the tax system is fair and sustainable in the long term.

The analysis of the budget and the possibility of a tax reform present themselves as interdependent elements that must be addressed simultaneously by the next government. The ability to execute effective policies in these areas could determine the country's economic direction in the coming years, constituting a crucial aspect that both voters and candidates must keep in mind in the electoral agenda.

Discussions surrounding these issues have gained relevance in recent days and could unconsciously influence citizens' decisions as the voting day approaches. With recent economic challenges at a global level, the focus is on how each candidate proposes to utilize the public budget to promote robust and sustainable development.","**March 6, 2024**

**Economists Urge Budget and Fiscal Reform**

In light of the upcoming presidential elections, economists emphasize the importance of analyzing and reforming the public budget to ensure cost-effective spending and increase revenue.

According to experts, the current public budget must undergo thorough scrutiny to identify areas where funds could be reallocated to programs that boost economic growth. This includes investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare, which are considered essential for long-term prosperity.

Furthermore, economists argue that tax reform is necessary to broaden the government's revenue base. By reducing exemptions and closing loopholes, the government could generate additional revenue that could be used to fund essential services and reduce the national debt.

""Whoever wins the elections, the challenge remains the same: we must ensure that our public budget is spent in a way that benefits the economy and its citizens,"" said Dr. John Smith, economist at the University of California, Berkeley.

""A well-designed tax reform can create a fairer and more equitable system while providing the necessary resources to invest in our future,"" he added.

As presidential candidates present their economic plans, economists urge the public to carefully consider the implications of budgetary and fiscal promises for the country's economic well-being.","On March 6, 2024. Public debt is an important problem because interest rates and public spending are high; however, there are significant issues regarding its impact on national and international GDP due to high external indebtedness (Fonan). Regarding the above, the budget deficit has been criticized for having excessive costs as a direct or indirect consequence of government policies. Furthermore, government spending has no relation whatsoever to current global economic growth or its actual outcomes.

Mexico has made a remarkable progress in human development, rising six positions in the Human Development Index (HDI) to rank 79th among 193 countries, according to a report published this Wednesday by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

The HDI is a composite indicator that measures the progress of countries in three essential dimensions: life expectancy at birth, education, and per capita income. The report highlights Mexico's improvements in these three aspects over the past year.

""This rise in the ranking is a testament to the country’s commitment to human development and the well-being of its population,"" stated Arturo Herrera, Regional Director of the UNDP for Latin America and the Caribbean.

Mexico has improved its life expectancy at birth by 0.2 years, reaching 75.2 years. It has also improved its literacy rate and the average number of years of schooling.

In terms of per capita income, Mexico has experienced moderate growth, partly due to the economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic.

*Mexico, April 11, 2024* – The water situation in Mexico has become an alarming crisis that not only affects the environment but also defines the living conditions of millions of citizens. In a context where the ecological abyss is no longer a warning for the future but a palpable reality, the critical water crisis facing the country has been highlighted.

Recently, it was reported that four central dams at the national level have ceased operations because they have run dry. At the same time, another twelve dams are in imminent danger, reporting storage levels below 5 percent of their capacity. This drastic decrease in water resources has generated concern among experts and the population.

Moreover, it has been warned that if the rainy season is delayed, the Cutzamala system, which supplies water to the vast metropolitan area of the country, could be rendered inoperative by June 31. This scenario would be devastating, as currently vast areas of Mexico's most populated cities lack access to the vital liquid for more than 25 percent of the year.

The causes of this crisis are multiple and complex, including the over-exploitation of water resources, unchecked urban growth, and climate changes that have altered precipitation patterns. The current situation raises troubling questions about water management in a country facing a potential collapse of its water system.

The future of Mexico regarding water availability depends on immediate and effective actions, as well as a greater social awareness of the importance of protecting and conserving this essential resource. In this context, it is urgent that both authorities and citizens actively participate in seeking solutions to this escalating ecological crisis.","**April 11, 2024, Mexico**

**The ecological abyss reaches Mexico: the water crisis defines the current reality**

In an alarming testimony of environmental degradation, Mexico faces a grim water future, where the ecological abyss is not merely a warning but a palpable reality affecting all of society.

Four crucial national dams have depleted their water reserves, while 12 more are on the brink of closure with capacity levels below 5%. The situation is alarming, especially considering that the Cutzamala system, which supplies the metropolitan area, faces an imminent closure on June 31 if the rains do not arrive in time.

Currently, wide swathes of the most populated cities in the country suffer from water shortages for more than three months a year, highlighting the severity of the crisis. The question that arises is: how did we get to this point? The answer lies in a complex set of factors that include climate change, unsustainable water management, rapid urban growth, and industrial pollution.

The government and environmental organizations are working hard to address the crisis, implementing conservation measures, improving infrastructure, and investing in exploring alternative water sources. However, experts warn that a concerted and long-term effort is needed to prevent Mexico from sinking further into the ecological abyss.","On April 11, 2024.

*Date: November 9, 2023*  
*Location: Mexico*

Despite the use of smartphones in Mexico ranging from 94 to 130 million units and the country having over 65 thousand points of free Internet access, less than half of doctors in the country provide virtual consultations. This alarming figure is further reduced, reaching only 19 percent among professionals in the public sector, according to a recent report from the Mexican Foundation for Health (Funsalud).

The report highlights the discrepancy between the high penetration of technology and the low utilization of digital tools in the medical field. Funsalud has noted that this situation limits access to health services, especially in rural areas and vulnerable communities, where healthcare is essential.

The use of virtual consultations has been identified as a viable alternative to improve care and reduce overcrowding in health centers; however, the lack of training and resources in the medical sector has been a significant obstacle to its effective implementation.

The Foundation called on health authorities and educational institutions to strengthen training in the management of digital platforms among health professionals. This could not only optimize medical care but also contribute to a more accessible and efficient healthcare system in the country.","**November 9, 2023**

**Mexico: Despite the high penetration of smartphones and the Internet, less than half of doctors offer virtual consultations**

**Mexico City:** Although in Mexico the use of smartphones ranges from 94 to 130 million units and free Internet connection points exceed 65,000, less than half of doctors offer virtual consultations, according to the Mexican Foundation for Health (Funsalud).

The figure is even lower in the public sector, where only 19% of physicians provide this type of care. This low percentage represents an obstacle to access health services, especially in remote areas or for people with limited mobility.

According to Funsalud, virtual consultations can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and expand the reach of medical care. However, they face barriers such as the lack of training for health professionals, patients' resistance to adopting new technologies, and infrastructure limitations in some regions.

The Foundation urges health authorities and medical associations to promote the adoption of virtual consultations as part of the provision of comprehensive health services. This would improve access to medical care, especially for those facing challenges in receiving in-person care.","On November 9, 2023.

This year, the Glastonbury Festival promises to be an unprecedented experience for the nearly 200,000 music lovers who will gather at the iconic musical event. The organizers have announced a series of new features that will ensure an enriched offering for attendees.

Among the most notable innovations is the incorporation of a digital platform that will allow artists to interact more directly with the audience, as well as the inclusion of a variety of musical genres that go beyond the usual offerings at the festival. Additionally, the participation of a selection of emerging artists has been confirmed, providing the opportunity to discover new talents on a world-renowned stage.

The Glastonbury Festival, which will take place in June, has been recognized over the years for its diversity and the quality of its performances, attracting music lovers from various corners of the world. With these new initiatives, the organizers aim not only to maintain its essence but also to offer a more inclusive and dynamic experience for all attendees.

Tickets are expected to sell out quickly, given the high demand generated by this year's announcement. Music lovers are already beginning to prepare for what promises to be another memorable chapter in the history of the Glastonbury Festival.","**March 15, 2024, London**

The nearly 200,000 music lovers gathering at Worthy Farm for this year's Glastonbury Festival will be able to enjoy a new and exciting experience. The festival organizers have partnered with a leading technology company to create an app that will enhance the experience of attendees in various ways.

The app will offer a variety of features, including:

* Personalization of the festival schedule
* Notifications about performances and events
* Interactive maps of the festival grounds
* Information on food and drink
* A forum to connect with other attendees

Organizers hope that the app will make the Glastonbury experience smoother and more enjoyable for all attendees. They also believe it will help reduce the festival's environmental impact by decreasing the need for printed material.

""We're thrilled to partner with a leading technology company to create this new and exciting app,"" said Emily Eavis, co-organizer of the Glastonbury Festival. ""We believe it will really enhance our attendees' experience and help us make the festival more sustainable.""

Regarding their personal future, artists can choose between their professional careers or other options. Despite this, musicians are forced to work tirelessly for months because they have very little money or enough financial resources to keep them busy while they prepare for the next annual event. Furthermore, if they do not come up with anything important, artists would lose all their rights over everything related to pop culture. For example, artists can choose from other projects, although they will not be able to participate directly in any official work due to legal limitations.
